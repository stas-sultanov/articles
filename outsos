Hi
My name is Stas and I'm working in it for about 20 years

This topic I would like to tell how to not get fucked up by working outsource or oustuff IT company.


1st of all what you must understand
that for right any company profit is on the first place.
which is also true for IT companies.
why it is important to understand is that because this is the unswer to most of the question why the fuck?!


So what is recipe to not be fucked up

Well first of all you must hire and motivate an IT expert whoum you may trust.
and you must motivate him.
Gesus christ you should hire some one who had hands on experience in implementation recently.
Unfortunatly I have seen to many times that companies hire CIO or CTO who don't give a fuck about IT like at all.
What they are expecting from them ?
